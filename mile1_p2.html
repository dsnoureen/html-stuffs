    <p>Tree plantation plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance and improving the environment. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, which helps purify the air and combat climate change. Their roots prevent soil erosion, conserve water, and maintain soil fertility. Trees also provide shelter and food for various species, supporting biodiversity. In urban areas, they help reduce heat and noise pollution while enhancing the aesthetic appeal of surroundings. Additionally, spending time around trees can improve mental well-being and physical health. Overall, tree plantation is a simple yet powerful step toward a greener and healthier planet</p>
