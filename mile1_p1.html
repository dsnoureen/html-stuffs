    <p class="c1">
        1. Object Detection on a Pathway (Obstacle Alert System)
 Narrative:
Imagine a robot or delivery bot that moves along a path in a warehouse or street. Sensors placed along the route detect obstacles (like humans, fallen objects). If any object blocks the path, the sensor sends a signal to pause the robot and trigger an alert.</p>

    <p class="c1">2. Signal Transmission & Acknowledgement Between Nodes (Basic Network Protocol)
 Narrative:
Build a two-way communication system between two nodes, where:

Node A sends a data packet.

Node B receives it and sends back an acknowledgment (ACK).
This mimics IoT message delivery confirmation or handshaking protocol.</p>

    <p class="c1">3. Intrusion Detection in a Restricted Area
 Narrative:
Youre simulating a border security system or home intrusion detection. Nodes (motion sensors) are placed around a perimeter. If movement is detected during unauthorized hours, an alert is triggered.</p>
